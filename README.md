# BellaBeat Case Study using Python

1. Project Title:
   Bellabeat Wellness Insights: Smart Device Usage Analysis with Python
   An end-to-end Python-based project analyzing Fitbit-derived wellness data to uncover user behavior, activity levels, and health patterns for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.
     
2. Purpose of the project:
   The project explores Fitbit fitness tracker data to understand how users engage with smart devices. The goal is to generate insights into activity, sleep, and calorie-burning behaviors that help Bellabeat shape data-         driven marketing strategies and product decisions.

3. Tech Stack:
   The project was built using the following tools and technologies:
   ✔ Python (Pandas, NumPy) – Data import, wrangling, and transformations
   ✔ Matplotlib & Seaborn – Visualizations and statistical plots
   ✔ Jupyter / Kaggle Notebook – Coding environment for reproducible workflows
   ✔ CSV Dataset (Fitbit) – Source of raw user activity data

4. Data Source: Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data (Kaggle – Survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk, 2016)
   ✔ Rows/Columns: 940 rows × 15 columns (daily activity data)
   Dataset fields include:
   ✔ User ID
   ✔ Activity Date
   ✔ Total Steps
   ✔ Total Distance & Tracker Distance
   ✔ Very Active / Moderately Active / Lightly Active / Sedentary Minutes
   ✔ Calories Burned
      Covers 33 users over a 1-month period (April–May 2016).
  
5. Features / Highlights:
   ✔ Business Problem: Bellabeat wants to understand user engagement with wellness devices to design marketing strategies and promote its smart products more effectively.
   ✔ Goal of the Project:
        ➡ Prepare, clean, and analyze Fitbit user activity data
        ➡ Categorize users into Sedentary, Active, Very Active groups
        ➡ Visualize wellness behavior (steps, calories, activity minutes, day-of-week patterns)
        ➡ Provide actionable insights for marketing and product positioning
   
   ✔ Walkthrough of Key Visuals:
      ➡ Scatter Plot (Steps vs Calories): Shows positive correlation between daily steps and calories burned, with user activity-level segmentation.
      ➡ Bar Chart (Average Steps by Day of Week): Reveals activity patterns; Wednesday and Saturday are most active, Thursday/Friday least active.
      ➡ Pie Chart (Activity Minutes %): 81% sedentary, 16% lightly active, 2% fairly active, 2% very active.
      ➡ Multi-Plot (Minutes vs Calories by Activity Level): Compares sedentary, lightly active, fairly active, and very active minutes with calorie burn, showing stronger correlations for active users.

   ✔ Business Impact & Insights:
      ➡ User Segmentation: Categorized into Sedentary (<6k steps), Active (6k–12k steps), Very Active (>12k steps).
      ➡ Marketing Strategy: Personalize campaigns by targeting active users differently from sedentary ones.
      ➡ Engagement Patterns: Device usage >16 hrs/day doesn’t guarantee high activity, highlighting opportunity for motivational nudges.
      ➡ Behavioral Insights: Users are less active on Thursdays/Fridays; potential for targeted interventions.
      ➡ Health Engagement: Majority of users are sedentary, suggesting opportunities to push wellness goals and app reminders.
